## K-Ary Tree FizzBuzz

## Summary

- This challenge involves implementing the FizzBuzz algorithm on a K-ary tree.

## Problem Domain

- Given a K-ary tree, implement the FizzBuzz algorithm on the values of each node in the tree. If a node's value is divisible by 3, replace it with "Fizz". If it is divisible by 5, replace it with "Buzz". If it is divisible by both 3 and 5, replace it with "FizzBuzz". Otherwise, leave the value unchanged.

## Approach and Efficiency

- The implementation involves traversing the tree and checking the value of each node. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. The space complexity is also O(n), as we need to create a new node for each node in the original tree.

## Big O

- The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. The space complexity is also O(n).
